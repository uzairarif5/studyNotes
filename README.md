# My Study Notes

This is my first big project that uses React.js and Redux

![React JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB") ![Redux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Redux-252525?style=for-the-badge&logo=redux&logoColor=7f51cb)

## Basic Use Guide:
- First page (from Home.js [1]) will show all the topics
- Clicking on one of the topics will send you to it's study note (from Article.js [2])
- Some study notes may have a worksheet link in the footer, clicking on it will send you to a built-in worksheet page (from Worksheet.js [3])
